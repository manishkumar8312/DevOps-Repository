## 1. Introduction to Cloud Computing

Definition
Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of computing services such as servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and analytics over 
the internet on a pay-as-you-go model.

Characteristics:

* On-demand self-service
* Broad network access
* Resource pooling (multi-tenancy)
* Rapid elasticity
* Measured service

Advantages:

* Cost-effective
* High scalability
* Global accessibility
* Reduced maintenance

Disadvantages:

* Internet dependent
* Security risks
* Vendor lock-in
* Limited control

## 2. Cloud Architecture: 

Cloud architecture mainly consists of:

* Front-End: Browsers, client devices, interfaces.
* Back-End: Servers, storage, databases, virtual machines, hypervisors.
* Virtualization Layer: Handles VM creation and resource abstraction.
* Management Layer: Security, monitoring, provisioning.
* Service Delivery Layer: IaaS, PaaS, SaaS.

---

## 3. Service Models:

### IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service):

* Provides virtual machines, storage, networks.
* User manages OS, applications.
* Examples: AWS EC2, Azure VM, GCP Compute Engine.

### PaaS (Platform as a Service):

* Provides OS, managed databases, runtimes.
* User manages application deployment.
* Examples: Google App Engine, Heroku.

### SaaS (Software as a Service):

* Provides complete software applications online.
* User only uses the service.
* Examples: Gmail, Salesforce, Google Docs.

## 4. Deployment Models

* Public Cloud: Open to general users (AWS, Azure).
* Private Cloud: Dedicated to one organization.
* Hybrid Cloud: Combination of public and private.
* Community Cloud: Shared by similar organizations (banks, universities).

## 5. Virtualization

Virtualization allows multiple VMs to run on one physical machine.

Types:

* Full virtualization
* Para virtualization
* OS-level virtualization

Hypervisors:

* Type 1 (Bare-metal): VMware ESXi
* Type 2 (Hosted): VirtualBox

---

## 6. Cloud Storage

Types:

* Object Storage (Amazon S3)
* Block Storage (AWS EBS)
* File Storage (NFS, Filestore)

Concepts:

* Replication
* Distributed file systems (GFS, HDFS)
* Data deduplication
* CDN

---

## 7. Cloud Security

Common Security Issues:

* Data breaches
* VM escape
* Insecure APIs
* DoS attacks
* Account hijacking

Security Mechanisms:

* IAM (Identity and Access Management)
* Encryption (SSL/TLS, AES)
* Firewalls
* Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)
* Secure APIs
* Backup & Disaster Recovery

---

## 8. Resource Management in Cloud

Important Functions:

* Resource provisioning
* Scheduling
* Monitoring
* Scaling
* Load balancing

Load Balancing Algorithms

* Round Robin
* Weighted Round Robin
* Least Connection

---

## 9. Cloud Data Management

Cloud Databases:

* SQL: AWS RDS, Cloud SQL
* NoSQL: DynamoDB, MongoDB Atlas

Big Data Tools:

* Hadoop
* Spark
* AWS EMR
* Google BigQuery

Data Lifecycle
Collection → Storage → Processing → Analysis → Backup → Archival

## 10. Open Source & Commercial Clouds

Open-Source Cloud Platforms

* OpenStack
* Eucalyptus
* OpenNebula
* Cloud Foundry

Commercial Cloud Platforms

* AWS
* Microsoft Azure
* Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
* IBM Cloud

OpenStack Components

* Nova (Compute)
* Swift (Object Storage)
* Cinder (Block Storage)
* Neutron (Networking)
* Keystone (Identity Management)

## 11. Research Trends: Edge & Fog Computing

Fog Computing

* Intermediate layer between edge and cloud
* Reduces latency and bandwidth usage
* Used in IoT systems

Edge Computing

* Computation done directly on end devices
* Extremely low latency
* Real-time processing

---

## 12. Virtual Machines vs Containers

Virtual Machines

* Heavyweight
* Includes full OS
* Uses hypervisors

Containers

* Lightweight
* Share OS kernel
* Faster deployment
* Tools: Docker, Kubernetes

---

## 13. Applications of Cloud Computing

* E-commerce
* Banking
* Healthcare
* Online Education Platforms
* Social Media
* Data Analytics
* IoT Systems
* Video Streaming (Netflix, Prime Video)
