# **DEVOPS ON CLOUD WITH BASIC LINUX COMMANDS**

---

## **1. Essentials of Cloud Computing**

Cloud computing is a technology that enables the **delivery of computing resources** such as servers, storage, databases, networking, and software over the **internet on demand**. Instead of owning and maintaining physical infrastructure, users can access resources whenever required and pay only for what they use.

Cloud computing provides **flexibility, scalability, and cost efficiency**, making it suitable for modern application development and DevOps practices.

### **Key Features of Cloud Computing**

* **On-demand self-service:** Resources can be provisioned automatically
* **Broad network access:** Accessible from anywhere using the internet
* **Resource pooling:** Multiple users share the same infrastructure
* **Rapid elasticity:** Resources can be scaled up or down
* **Measured service:** Pay-as-you-use pricing model

---

## **2. Cloud Architecture and Virtualization**

### **Cloud Architecture**

Cloud architecture refers to the **structural design** of cloud components and how they interact with each other to deliver services.

It mainly consists of:

* **Front end:** Client-side components such as browsers or applications
* **Back end:** Servers, storage systems, and databases
* **Management layer:** Controls resource allocation, security, and monitoring
* **Virtualization layer:** Enables efficient resource sharing

---

### **Virtualization**

Virtualization is a technology that allows **multiple virtual machines (VMs)** to run on a **single physical machine**. It uses a software layer called a **hypervisor**, which manages hardware resources and allocates them to each VM.

### **Advantages of Virtualization**

* Efficient use of hardware resources
* Reduced infrastructure cost
* Isolation between applications
* Improved scalability and flexibility

## **3. Different Cloud Providers**

Cloud providers offer infrastructure, platforms, and software services over the internet.

### **Major Cloud Providers**

* **Amazon Web Services (AWS):** Largest and most widely used cloud platform
* **Microsoft Azure:** Popular for enterprise and Microsoft-based solutions
* **Google Cloud Platform (GCP):** Known for analytics and machine learning
* **IBM Cloud:** Focused on hybrid cloud solutions

Each provider supports DevOps tools and automation services.

---

## **4. Why We Need DevOps on Cloud**

Traditional DevOps implementations on on-premise infrastructure face challenges such as limited scalability, high maintenance cost, and slower provisioning.

Cloud platforms naturally support DevOps practices.

### **Reasons for Using DevOps on Cloud**

* **Scalability:** Infrastructure can be scaled automatically
* **Automation:** Easy integration of CI/CD pipelines
* **High availability:** Cloud ensures fault tolerance
* **Cost efficiency:** No upfront hardware investment
* **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Infrastructure can be managed through code

Thus, DevOps on cloud enables **faster, reliable, and continuous software delivery**.

## **5. Introduction to Amazon Web Services (AWS)**

Amazon Web Services is a **cloud computing platform** that provides a wide range of **on-demand services** for computing, storage, networking, and security.

AWS allows DevOps teams to **build, deploy, and manage applications** efficiently.

### **Important AWS Services**

* **EC2:** Provides virtual servers
* **S3:** Scalable object storage
* **RDS:** Managed relational databases
* **IAM:** Manages user access and permissions
* **CloudWatch:** Monitoring and logging service

AWS is widely used in DevOps due to its **scalability and automation support**.

---

## **6. Continuous Integration (CI)**

Continuous Integration is a DevOps practice where developers **frequently merge code changes** into a shared repository. Each change is automatically **built and tested** to identify errors early.

CI improves code quality and reduces integration issues.

### **Advantages of CI**

* Early bug detection
* Improved collaboration
* Faster development cycles

---

## **7. Continuous Delivery (CD)**

Continuous Delivery ensures that the software is **always ready for deployment**. After automated testing, the software can be deployed to production **with manual approval**.

CD helps organizations release software **quickly and reliably**.

---

## **8. Continuous Deployment**

Continuous Deployment is an advanced form of CD in which **every successful code change** that passes testing is **automatically deployed** to production without manual intervention.

It enables rapid feature delivery and faster feedback from users.

---

## **9. Continuous Monitoring**

Continuous Monitoring is the process of **continuously observing system performance**, application behavior, and infrastructure health.

It helps in:

* Detecting failures early
* Ensuring system reliability
* Improving user experience

Monitoring tools collect logs, metrics, and alerts.

---

## **10. Basic Linux Commands**

Linux is the most commonly used operating system in cloud and DevOps environments due to its stability and security.

### **File and Directory Management**

* `ls` – Lists files and directories
* `cd` – Changes directory
* `pwd` – Displays current directory
* `mkdir` – Creates new directory

### **File Operations**

* `cp` – Copies files
* `mv` – Moves or renames files
* `rm` – Deletes files or directories

### **Permissions and Ownership**

* `chmod` – Changes file permissions
* `chown` – Changes file ownership

### **Process Management**

* `ps` – Displays running processes
* `top` – Shows real-time process usage
* `kill` – Terminates a process

### **Networking Commands**

* `ping` – Checks network connectivity
* `ifconfig` or `ip` – Displays network configuration

---

## **11. Relationship Between DevOps, Cloud, and Linux**

* **Cloud** provides scalable and on-demand infrastructure
* **Linux** provides a stable and secure operating environment
* **DevOps** provides automation and continuous delivery practices

Together, they form the foundation of **modern software development and deployment**.

---

## **12. Conclusion**

DevOps on cloud, supported by Linux, enables organizations to **automate development, deployment, and monitoring processes**. Cloud computing provides scalability, Linux ensures system stability, and DevOps practices ensure continuous improvement and faster software delivery.
